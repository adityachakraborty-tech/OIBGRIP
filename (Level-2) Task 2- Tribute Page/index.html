                <h2> Indian Businessman & Former Chairman of the Tata Group</h2>
                <p><b>Ratan Naval Tata</b> (Ratan Tata, born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist,
                    philanthropist, and a former chairman of Tata Sons. He was the chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to
                    2012, and again, as interim chairman, from October 2016 through February 2017, and continues to head
                    its charitable trusts.He is the recipient of two civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan
                    (2008), the second highest civilian honour, and the Padma Bhushan (2000), the third highest civilian
                    honour.Born in 1937, he is an heir of the Tata family, and son of Naval Tata who was later adopted
                    by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group. He is an alumnus of the Cornell
                    University College of Architecture and Harvard Business School through the Advanced Management
                    Program that he completed in 1975.[6] He joined his company in 1961 when he used to work on the shop
                    floor of Tata Steel, and was the apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon the latter's retirement in
                    1991. He got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to
                    acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centrist group into a global
                    business. Around 60-65% of his profits are donated to charity making him one of the most significant
                    philanthropists in the world. </p>

                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>In 2011, Ratan Tata stated, "I came close to getting married four times and each time I backed off in
                    fear or for one reason or another." Ratan Tata stated recently that he loved one girl in Los Angeles
                    while working there. As his family member was ill, he had to return to India but the parents of the
                    girl didn't allow her to come to India with Tata. So, Tata stood by his commitment and never
                    married.Tata is a supporter of education, medicine and rural development, and considered a leading
                    philanthropist in India. Tata supported University of New South Wales Faculty of Engineering to
                    develop capacitive deionization to provide improved water for challenged areas.Ratan Tata received
                    the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and Padma Vibhushan in 2008, the third and second highest civilian honours
                    awarded by the Government of India</p>
